I thought this article was interesting, because when it comes to client-side tracking, I was only familiar with mechanisms such as cookies, localStorage, and sessions. But there are two more features I have come to learn:

Pixels:
    For example, you’re looking for a chocolate workshop and land on website A. Inside you saw a workshop that looked interesting and clicked on the “read more” button to get more information. The pixel attached to the “read more” button fires, and that data is registered in some advertising platform, let’s say Facebook. You’re not sure about that workshop, so you go back to scroll your Facebook feed for some funny cat videos. However, you suddenly see an advertisement for that exact workshop from website A. You just saw a retargeting pixel in action.

SDK:
    In the context of Client-side tracking, SDK’s are simply code snippets you add to your site, similar to the other implementation methods. The difference lies in how you configure these code snippets. For Pixel and Cookie based tracking, you simply paste it, and you’re pretty much done. The rest of the work is done for you. The SDK based approach requires you to handle customer identification and event tracking yourself.

I really enjoyed reading this article because it was an easy to read article that went over what client-side tracking is. I was able to follow through and understand what the author is saying.
